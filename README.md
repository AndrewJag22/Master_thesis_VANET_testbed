# Master_thesis_VANET_testbed
This repository provides code and installation instruction to complement my master thesis. 

Installation instructions:

This installation instruction only covers setup and execution of simulated scenarios. The approach for using it with real drones is quite similar. There are two differences. When using real drones, there is no need for running ArduPilot SITL. The other difference is that MAVProxy needs to be started manually for each drone when real drones are used. For drones simulated with ArduPilot SITL, MAVProxy is automatically started for each drone instance.
